### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Walter Beck and I'm studying C# .NET Programming at Tech Elevator. I bring 20+ years in marketing, design, and communications to the table. As a nimble lifelong learner and team player I am looking to use my strategic and problem-solving skills in a junior developer, QA, or other role. Open to any recommendations.

I'll be updating my GitHub as I graduate in April but for now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently neck deep, immersed in Tech Elevator's Bootcamp
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning vue.js this week
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to stay focused on the core competencies
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterbeck
